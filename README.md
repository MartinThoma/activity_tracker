## Install

Currently this is not a package. You need to install the prerequesites:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and then run it within this folder.

## Usage

```python
python is_active.py
```

This produces a CSV file [like this](https://gist.github.com/MartinThoma/d8dbccb795016bc5c1090b8f48c1ed0d).
